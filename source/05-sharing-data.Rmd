  - Why share data?
* Data sharing basics
  - qualitative recommendations
  - data management life cycle
* Advanced data sharing (maybe this is too intimidating)
  - Repositories
  - Metadata
  - Provenance
* Best practices guide (this could also be a box maybe)
  - summarize best practices as a list from previous sections.
* Use case
  - Show example with rOpenSci package suite
    * Read in sample data (maybe a small data set one of us has collected)
    * Document with EML
    * Share on figshare



## Introduction


* Why share data? 
  - The virtues of sharing data
  - increased citation
* Best practices for sharing data
  - How to format your data for sharing
* Metadata 
  - It's your friend, why you should care
  - Enhanced discoverability
  - What format do you choose?
  - Using EML package (NeXML too?)
* Repositories
  - Where can you share your data?
    * KNB, Figshare, Dryad, DataONE?
* Use case
  - Sharing data with rfigshare
  - Creating EML and pushing to KNB?


## Data sharing basics

<!-- I think this is 
-->
Follow guides provided by repositories and literature of your field.  For instance, recent papers 

<!--Don't need to list all these, but good to highlight how our tools make all these things easy -->

[White et al. 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.4033%2Fiee.v6i2.4608) Nine simple ways: 

1. Share your data.
2. Provide metadata.
3. Provide an unprocessed form of the data.
4. Use standard data formats.
5. Use good null values.
6. Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets
7. Perform basic quality control.
8. Use an established repository.
9. Use an established and liberal license.

[Cranston et al 2014](http://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fcurrents.tol.bf01eff4a6b60ca4825c69293dc59645) "Best practices for data sharing in phylogenetics research.

1. Manage your data for sharing from the start
2. Publish your data (not just figures of your data)
3. CC0 license maximizes reuse
4. Include a README 
5. Provide meaningful labels (for taxa)
6. Use consistent labels (for taxa)
7. Provide all the data, all the code
8. Defines the MIAPA checklist: https://github.com/miapa/miapa/blob/master/checklist/MIAPA-checklist.md
9. "Provide complete and easily reusable information about characters, character states, and the specimens from which they are derived"
10. Educate yourself on data management practices in your field






Heirarchical checklist for data sharing: (de Waard http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard/slides-for-workshop-on-discovery-informatics)

- [ ] Preserved (in any format)
- [ ] Archived (long-term, software-agnostic format)
- [ ] Accessible
- [ ] Comprehensible
- [ ] Discoverable (e.g. indexed by metadata, search system)
- [ ] Reproducible (comprehensive enough metadata that others can reproduce it)
- [ ] Trusted (e.g. validated or checked by peer review)
- [ ] Citable (e.g. unique identifier, can count citations)
- [ ] Usable (executable code, machine readable metadata)
