## Why an R package?

Going from less to more complicated: a few lines of code to accomplish a task, a function to generalize that task, an R package to accomplish a similar set of tasks. An R package can be complicated to make, but can have great payoffs even if the package is only for your own use. R packages have their own namespaces so you can embed function names that may clash with others within the package name like `packagename::functionname`. In addition, you can easily add documentation with parameter explanation and examples for ease of use. There is an easy to use framework for incorporating tests as well (see _Testing_ section below), essential for creating robust software. The `devtools` package was created to make the package creating process easy - we'll go over `devtools` more below. 

## The basics of developing R packages

Hadley Wickham has a nice overview of general R package creation in his book [**Advanced R programming**][advr]. A general workflow for creating an R package is as follows (let's say the package name is _foobar_ for this example):

```coffee
library('devtools')
create('foobar')
```

Optionally, you can set the path to the package in the call to `create()`, which creates a package skeleton with the basic files you need to make a package:

```
/foobar
  /DESCRIPTION
  /man
  /R/foobar-package.r
```

For each function or set of similar functions create a file in the `R/` directory.

## Writing functions to interact with web data

## Documenting packages

## Documenting functions

## Testing

Testing has become quite easy in R packages with the recent arrival of the [`testthat` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html). 

## Continuous integration

Continuous integration is a way to integrate your R package with a framework for building, testing, and running any examples from your package. The easiest way to do this is using [Travis-CI][travis]. Travis-CI builds your package, and runs any tests. etc. that you describe in a `.travis.yml` file. There is an ongoing project lead by Google's [Craig Citro](https://github.com/craigcitro/) to better support R within Travis-CI. The following is an example `.travis.yml` file:

```
language: c
script: ./travis-tool.sh run_tests
before_script:
- curl -OL http://raw.github.com/craigcitro/r-travis/master/scripts/travis-tool.sh
- chmod 755 ./travis-tool.sh
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal1 libgdal1-dev netcdf-bin libproj-dev
- ./travis-tool.sh bootstrap
- ./travis-tool.sh install_deps
- ./travis-tool.sh github_package assertthat
```

Putting this `.travis.yml` file in the root of your R package will run a build on Travis-CI on each of your commits to your Github repository. Remember to add `.travis.yml` to your `.Rbuildignore` file in your R package so that the file is ignored on R builds. 

## Publishing to CRAN

## Quick reference

* Create package (from `devtools` package): `create("pkg_name")`
* Run tests in package (from `testthat` package): `test_package("pkg_name")` or `check("pkg_name")` will run tests as part of `R CMD CHECK` process
* Publish package to CRAN (from `devtools` package): `release("pkg_name")`
* 

## Further reading

* Hadley Wickham has a book in progress called Advanced R programming, which has a number of sections on developing R packages. Find it at [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/][advr].
* Hadley Wickham has a set of best practices for developing R packages to interact with web APIs within the `httr` package at [https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/vignettes/api-packages.Rmd](https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/vignettes/api-packages.Rmd).
